                <p>Beginning with children ages 5-9, we believe in setting a critical foundation that can lead to the success
                    of a child's swimming career. Our coaches teach these children the fundamentals of swimming, including strokes,
                    basic stroke technique, dives, and turns. This age group also offers a variety of competition events that help
                    test a swimmer's ability in the water, as well as introduce competitive sportsmanship through other young swimmers
                    in this age range. This group practices 3 times a week.

                <p>After our children's age group, many swimmers transition to the Middle Age Group. This group of swimmers, ages 10-15,
                    train more than before and develop their swimming skills even further. With dedicated coaching, many of these swimmers begin to 
                    visualize their stroke technique and apply it to themselves to improve on their swims. Swimmers also develop more endurance
                    through practices. More competitive events are also available for these swimmers. This group practice 4 times a week.

                <p>Our advanced group contains swimmers that are typically ages 16-18. Swimmers may elevate to this stage earlier if applicable.
                    Our advanced group contains individuals who exceed in their swimming career and wish to focus solely on competition and improving
                    their stroke to the best of their ability. Many swimmers in this group perform at national level competitions against other swimmers.
                    The advanced group practices 5 times a week with 3 conditional workouts a week as well.
